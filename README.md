# smart_fatigue_relieve_system
It detects the human condition whether he/she is tired or not tired. Based on human condition ,electrical appliances will control and do some necessary things to get relief from tiredness.

# Main principle behind this .
Using Computer vision algorithms we detect facial condition of humans . Based on results micro controller will do necessary actions like controlling AC and other
electrical appliances to relieve tiredness

# Scope for Innovtion
We propose a fully automated Smart System which is independent of manual intervention. It Automatically detects human condition by image processing and control the electrical appliances so that we save power by turning ON only when human requires and relieve from fatigue automatically.

# Current status in the market

Today in the market there are semi-automation which will be controlled by voice commands/controls . But we propose a fully automated Smart System which is independent of manual intervention and get relieve from fatigue.

# How this works
